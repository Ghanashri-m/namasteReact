## Q: What is `Emmet`?
A: `Emmet` is the essential toolkit for web-developers. It allows you to `type shortcuts` that are then expanded into full pieces of code for writing `HTML and CSS`, based on an abbreviation structure most developers already use that expands into full-fledged HTML markup and CSS rules.

`Alternate definition`: Emmet is a free add-on for your text editor. It allows you to type shortcuts that are then expanded into full pieces of code. By using Emmet, developers type less, they save both on keystrokes and time. Also relying on Emmet's auto completion means fewer typos and missing tags, leading to more robust and valid files.


## Q: Difference between a `Library and Framework`?
A: A `library` is a collection of packages that perform specific operations whereas a `framework` contains the basic flow and architecture of an application. The major difference between them is the complexity. Libraries contain a number of methods that a developer can just call whenever they write code. React js is library and Angular is Framework.
The `framework` provides the flow of a software application and tells the developer what it needs and calls the code provided by the developer as required. If a `library` is used, the application calls the code from the library.


## Q: What is `CDN`? Why do we use it?
A: A `content delivery network (CDN)` refers to a geographically distributed group of servers that work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.
The main use of a CDN is to deliver content through a network of servers in a secure and efficient way.


## Q: Why is `React known as React`?
A: `React` is named React because of its ability to `react to changes in data`.
React is called React because it was designed to be a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
The name `React` was chosen because the library was designed to allow developers to "react" to changes in state and data within an application, and to update the user interface in a declarative and efficient manner.
`React` is a `JavaScript-based UI development library`. `Facebook` and an `open-source developer community` run it.


## Q: What is `crossorigin in script tag`?
A: The `crossorigin` attribute sets the mode of the request to an HTTP CORS Request. 
The purpose of crossorigin attribute is to share the resources from one domain to another domain. Basically, it is used to handle the CORS request that checks whether it is safe to allow for sharing the resources from other domains.
### _Syntax_
```sh
<script crossorigin="anonymous|use-credentials">
```

The `crossorigin` attribute in the `script` tag is used to allow scripts to be loaded from external domains (i.e., domains other than the one hosting the HTML file) while enforcing certain security restrictions to prevent malicious attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS).

When a script is loaded from an external domain, the browser sends a "cross-origin request" to retrieve the script file. The `crossorigin` attribute allows the server hosting the script file to specify whether the browser should be allowed to make this request, and if so, what type of access should be granted to the response.

The `crossorigin` attribute can take three values: `anonymous`, `use-credentials`, or an `empty string`. Here's a brief explanation of each value:

`anonymous`: This is the default value. It indicates that the script file should be loaded without any credentials, such as cookies or HTTP authentication. This is typically used for scripts that are publicly available and don't require authentication.

`use-credentials`: This value indicates that the script file should be loaded with credentials. This is typically used for scripts that require authentication or for which the server needs to identify the requesting user.

`Empty string`: If the `crossorigin` attribute is present but has no value, the browser will treat it as if the value were set to `anonymous`.

Using the `crossorigin` attribute in the `script` tag helps to protect your website from potential security vulnerabilities by ensuring that only trusted scripts are loaded from external domains. It's important to note, however, that the `crossorigin` attribute only works if the server hosting the script file has explicitly allowed cross-origin requests for that file.


## Q: What is difference between `React and ReactDOM`?
A: `React` is a JavaScript library for building User Interfaces whereas `ReactDOM` is also JavaScript library that allows `React to interact with the DOM`.
The react package contains `React.createElement()`, `React.Component`, `React.Children`, and other helpers related to elements and component classes. You can think of these as the isomorphic or universal helpers that you need to build components. The react-dom package contains `ReactDOM.render()`, and in react-dom/server we have server-side rendering support with `ReactDOMServer.renderToString()` and `ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup()`.


## Q: What is difference between `react.development.js` and `react.production.js` files via `CDN`?
A: `Development` is the stage of an application before it's made public while `production` is the term used for the same application when it's made `public`.
`Development build` is several times (maybe 3-5x) `slower` than the `production build`.
The production files are `minified`.


## Q: What is `async and defer`?
A: `Async` - The async attribute is a `boolean attribute`. The script is downloaded in `parallel(in the background)` to parsing the page, and `executed as soon` as it is available (do not block HTML DOM construction during downloading process) and donâ€™t wait for anything.
### _Syntax_
```sh
<script src="demo_async.js" async></script>
```

`Defer` - The defer attribute is a `boolean attribute`. The script is downloaded in `parallel(in the background)` to parsing the page, and `executed after the page` has finished parsing(when browser finished DOM construction). The `defer attribute` tells the browser `not to wait for the script`. Instead, the browser will continue to process the HTML, build DOM.
### _Syntax_
```sh
<script src="demo_defer.js" defer></script>
```
